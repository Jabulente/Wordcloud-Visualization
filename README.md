# Wordcloud Visualization

This project is designed to process and visualize textual data using a **WordCloud**. The goal is to transform raw text into a visual representation that highlights the most frequent words, giving insight into the key themes and topics present in the data. Word clouds are a powerful tool for text analysis, providing an intuitive and easy way to visually interpret the frequency of words in a corpus.


### Features:
- Extract and preprocess textual data for visualization.
- Generate Wordclouds with customizable shapes, colors, and layouts.
- Highlight key insights by emphasizing frequently occurring terms.

### Applications:
- Summarizing survey feedback or reviews.
- Visualizing dominant themes in documents.
- Enhancing text-based reports with engaging visual summaries.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- `wordcloud`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `string`
- `pandas`

You can install the necessary libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install wordcloud nltk matplotlib pandas
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git https://github.com/Jabulente/Wordcloud-Visualization.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Wordcloud-Visualization
```

3. Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Modify the `input_text.txt` file or use your own text file to input the raw text.

## Example Usage

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and preprocess text
text = preprocess_text("input_text.txt")

# Generate the WordCloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)

# Display the generated WordCloud
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

## Customization

- **Stopwords**: Customize the stopwords list to filter out specific words from your corpus.
- **WordCloud Settings**: Adjust the appearance of the word cloud (e.g., font, color, maximum words, etc.) by tweaking the parameters of the `WordCloud` function.
- **Text Source**: You can input text from different sources, such as web scraping, CSV files, or direct input, depending on the project's needs.
